How often do members ask you for booking? Every half an hour, 10 - 15 minutes? Anyway, it happens very often as booking a meeting room is one of the most common routines when you manage a coworking space. 

If you don't have specific usable software that automates the process, you probably schedule all bookings in Google calendar. You share it with members or sometimes make reservations yourself. 

May I ask you if you are happy with this solution for meeting room booking? 

## Google Calendar for Meeting Room Booking ‚Äî Usability Issues  

Consider the points below highlighting the issues with Google Calendar for meeting room booking. Are they true for your coworking space?

- Two members make a reservation at the same time. The usage of Google Calendar does not prevent **booking conflicts**.
- As all members use the same calendar anyone can accidentally remove any event and **reservation disappears**.
- Marking reservations in Google Calendar can hardly be called an intuitive meeting room booking process which leads to lower usage, so the next issue is the **low utilization rate**.
- There are no stated meeting room booking rules in Google Calendar, which leads to **unfair use**. For instance, any room can be booked for a too long period by the same person.
- There is **no meeting space use statistics**, which is not very good for management, you don't see the numbers and have to make additional efforts to figure out what's going on in your space. 
- With Google Calendar you handle each reservation request manually, which is **time-consuming**, especially if your coworking space gives free hours to members.

The takeaway here is that if you want to optimize meeting room booking at your space, you need to [automate it](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/how-to-automate-meeting-room-booking-in-a-coworking-space). andcards provides a simple tool to automate the meeting room booking system. It is available for all members on all popular platforms such as web, Android and iOS. You don't need to get distracted by your clients asking for a room reservation every 30 min ü§Ø

It comes with several configurations for your convenience.

## Booking System Settings

In this section, you will learn how to tweak a booking system to fit your needs better. 

### Set the Range of Time for Reservation (From/Until)

You can set the range of time when people can make room reservations. You can keep it from 00:00 to 24:00 as it is by default, but we recommend setting more realistic values. You don't want members to call you at night complaining that the door is closed, do you? In addition, it is just more convenient to see reservations on the calendar view.

### Set the Period of Booking

Limit the period of booking if you don't want people to make room reservations, say, for the next year. Here you can set up the maximum time people can book ahead of today.

### Set the Available Days

There are days when your space is closed. Turn off the booking system for weekends or other days when you need a time out. It helps you to make sure people never book when you are closed and there are no complains about not informing them.

### Require Booking Purpose

Want to know why people book rooms? This is essential if you want to improve user experience. You can use this information to analyze the usage and install additional equipment e.g. whiteboard when you notice members use the room for open team discussions.

### Free Hour Credit System

Do you have free hours at your space? Do your members have free hours to book meeting space? This is what "credits" are for. Credits are the virtual currency to book space at your coworking. Instead of just giving hours to members for free, you give them [booking credits](https://andcards.com/blog/software/meeting-room-credits-at-a-coworking-space) (as a reward, once a month, when they sign up, when they continue the subscription, as an additional argument to seal the deal.) Members can use available credits whenever they wish.

It is important to provide limited access to meeting rooms even if it is unlimited in your space. People often make reservations and don't use them because they take it for granted. Why should they care for something free and unlimited? Once you give them credits, members realize it's not unlimited, value free hours more, and use credits carefully only when they actually need.

Members can have an individual, as well as team shared credit balances. You can add a touch of gamification and select a custom emoji symbol for your credits, for example: ‚≠êÔ∏è, üíé, üí∞ or any other.

#### Give Credits Monthly

This feature works really great with membership plans. Once you assign a plan to your customer, they automatically receive credits with their plan. If a membership plan is purchased for a long time, say a year, this option becomes very useful to retain and reward customers on a monthly basis. When on, andcards will give credits every month instead of giving them all at once.

## Meeting Room Settings

Here are some simple room-specific settings that will help you make a coworking booking system even more user-friendly.

### Add Images

People like to see what they buy. It's natural that they may want to see if the room is suitable for them or not, especially if they are new in your space. Adding a room image helps members make a well-grounded decision to book your space.

### Give Rooms Creative Names

Give meeting rooms unique names so people can identify them more easily. Be creative and give some cool names like Mars, Venus, etc. Very soon you'll make sure that stylized rooms are more attractive for the visitors.  

### Add Room Descriptions

The description helps to better understand the purpose of the room. You can also list available equipment. 

**For example:**

- projector,
- monitor,
- whiteboard,
- WiFi password, as well as write specific booking rules and regulations.

### State the Number of Seats

You can identify the number of seats available in a meeting room.

It's always good to indicate seat count so that one person doesn't book a 20-seat conference room for a one-on-one meeting.

### Set Hourly Prices for Workstations 

Your rooms may be free or cost money to use. Set an hourly price and start making money right away. Members will see an option to pay with debit or credit card on the booking page. This is very usable because users want to know how much coworking will cost to plan their budget accordingly.

### State Price in Credits

Indicate the number of credits needed to make a room reservation, and members will be able to pay with individual or team credit balances. I have already mentioned above what credits are, meeting room price set in credits will help members to use them wisely. 

### Minimum and Maximum Reservation Time

This is an extra feature that helps utilize rooms fairly. Minimum time ensures nobody books a 100-seat conference hall for 15 minutes. Maximum time allows to prevent free room overbooking. Of course, andcards makes sure there are no two meetings at the same time in the same room. No fights with "I booked first"-like arguments anymore! ü•ä

## Extra Features

Do you follow me so far? Great! Here is bonus info on the meeting room booking system for you.

### Access Control

When members book meeting rooms, andcards can allow access to the room only within a booking time. Preventing unauthorized use of a meeting room is important when room booking is paid. This is a way to prevent people from just walking in and using the space for free.

### Export to Calendar

Many people want to use a single calendar in order to see a schedule of the day. Want to see your bookings in your favorite calendar?

- Open the andcards suite app.
- Go to a "Profile" tab.
- Click on a "Calendar Sync" button.
- Follow the instructions.
