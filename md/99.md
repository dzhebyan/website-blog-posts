Coworking industry has entered the stage of high-speed development. New spaces pop up here and there like mushrooms after the rain. The demand for coworking space services is growing stronger each day, so the tendency will continue to  gain momentum. The competition in the market is going to get even more fierce than before and you should be ready to keep your business afloat.

A lot of smart entrepreneurs choose to specialize their coworking spaces to succeed. You can see it on the local map:

- [spaces for pet supplies entrepreneurs](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/pet-friendly-coworking-spaces-pros-cons-concerns), 
- for musicians, 
- [female-focused](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/gender-oriented-coworking-as-a-current-business-trend), 
- for creatives, 
- [coworkings in the countryside](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/coworking-in-the-countryside-for-those-who-need-to-keep-close-to-wifi), etc.      

In this article, I would like to talk about cooking coworking spaces. Everybody likes tasty food but some people feel a special passion for it. They are cooks, chefs, restaurant and café owners, in a word, entrepreneurs connected to food, cooking, and catering industry.

Food-related business niche is broad, so you are not likely to watch the empty desks in your coworking place for food startups. However, before announcing your space a culinary one, you need to know how to meet the professional requirements of your prospective members. I hope this article will sort the things out.    

## What is a Kitchen Coworking

A food-focused coworking is a place gathering caterers, ice cream makers, chocolate makers, pastry chefs, packaged food products sellers, apricot jam, banana bread manufacturers, and other businessmen working in the industry.

Most often, those people are determined to introduce new, unique foods to the mainstream market. 

For instance, an ice cream maker may be experimenting with new exotic flavors. A coffee company may be trying to mix coffee, soda, and natural juice in a bubbly composition.

### **What do those innovative cooks come to the best food coworking for?** 

They pay for more than just access to a kitchen. They come for valuable guidance, advice, and mentorship. 

The problem of food startups and minor brands is that it's extremely difficult to get off the ground, a really bank-breaking experience. 

However, good food coworking gives them easy access to professionals who steer them in the direction of lawyers, fundraisers, social media strategists, nutrition specialists, food photographers, and more. These mentors are invited to community events and happy hours. 

Besides, chefs can swap recipes and try them out immediately at the kitchen stations, which transforms food coworking into an incubator, test kitchen, and commissary for emerging food and beverage brands.

> The takeaway is that a coworking space for food startups is more than just a number of amenities. It should offer an array of value-added services, including mentorship opportunities, strategic resources, partnership, early-stage investment, month-to-month office rentals and access to a supportive community to facilitate businesses launch, grow and thrive.

## Special Amenities of a Coworking Space for Food Startups

![Kitchen utensils on the hanger](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/eat-live-cowork-food-coworking-spaces-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Cooking coworkings are very special, not to say sacred places for their members. Think about it like this. Where is the warmest, the coziest, the best-smelling place at home? It's a kitchen. All heart-to-heart talks take place there. The family gathers in the kitchen at least once a day to eat tasty food, drink tea, and discuss the events of the day.

We invite our closest friends to the kitchen, share secrets, news, gossips, woes, whatever. A kitchen is the heart of any home. 

The same is true for the coworking kitchen. It has a special atmosphere  that encourages and initiates the most sincere communication. You need to take care of that at your space with a café-style design and additional facilities (apart from high-speed internet, ergonomic furniture, and office utensils). 

### **Your guests will be happy with the following amenities:**

- Hot desks
- Dedicated desks
- Private offices
- Conference rooms for R&D and merchandising
- Complimentary fresh fruit water
- Coffee
- Ping-pong or some other sport areas
- Food pantry
- Large event space
- Commercial kitchen
- Kitchen space fitted out with essential commercial kitchen equipment
- Fit-outs and storage space
- Cooking community

I have already mentioned above that active community and membership benefits are extremely important for a food-focused coworking space. That means you should arrange events on a regular basis and invite famous chefs and industry influencers to speak there.

### **Types of events you can host at your cooking class coworking:**

- Member demo days
- Culinary workshops
- Classes
- Training
- Talks
- Tastings
- Food cultures celebrations, and other events that allow a member to have fun whilst learning a new skill.

> **Pro tip:** It will be much easier for you to manage your space, events, and membership benefits using [coworking software](https://andcards.com/). This way you can be sure that all loyal members are rewarded with benefits and properly notified about upcoming events, that the processes of new members registration, meeting room booking, payment, and access are optimized.
