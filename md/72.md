Gone are the days when people had to get up early in the morning and hurry to the office rain or fire. Now we have the freedom of choice. You can sign a contract with any company from overseas and work remotely. Not everyone is ready to leave the country to find a dream job. All of us have roots, ties, and responsibilities. Remote employment is a great chance to balance personal life and career without any sacrifice. 

This is especially topical for women. When you are taking care of the family and raising kids, it's not that easy to embody a professional ambition. The flexibility of remote contracts when you choose when and where to work is one of the ways to go for a modern business lady.

## Catering to Specific Female Requirements

Well, suppose you are a woman-entrepreneur. You applied to the position of your dream, and they agreed that you would work remotely. You have a bunch of your weekly tasks that must be completed on time. 

You can accomplish some of them from your home laptop but for the rest, you need faster internet, powerful desktop computer, printer, scanner, the list goes on.

Furthermore, you need to carry out several meetings with peers, customers, and partners. You must look professional to make a good impression. You can't efficiently pitch your service to the customer with your kids curiously peeking into your monitor, your cat trying to lie on your keypad, your mom coming unexpectedly to see her grandchildren, and many other cute things that scare your boss, partners, and customers a mile. 

### Heading to Coworking Space 

![Female Hand Holding a Pen](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/gender-oriented-coworking-as-a-current-business-trend-1.jpg|height=1080,width=1920) 

After a dozen of unavailing attempts to write a brilliant product description, you understand that your time-management goes flop. You could do it if you have 15 minutes of peace. But this luxury is unobtainable at home. 

You decide to go to the nearest coworking space but then recollect that your toddler's nanny has day off, you have an appointment at the beauty salon, and your fitness coach is waiting for you at the gym. 

#### From Storytelling to Reality     

Now let's interrupt our story and talk about marketing. Ideally, before developing a product, an entrepreneur must clearly understand who is their targeted audience, what are their pains, and how the innovative product will help to relieve those pains. 

Then we create a persona (our prospective customer), name them, state their gender, marital status, kids, pets, hobbies, occupations, job, in a word everything that can help us tailor an irresistible sales pitch. 

Does this make sense to you? That is the reason why we are talking about gender-oriented coworking as an excellent innovative way of running a business.

## Female-oriented Design of the Coworking Space

![Female Reading a Magazine](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/gender-oriented-coworking-as-a-current-business-trend-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920) 

A gender coworking must take into consideration the difference in male and female tastes and perception. 

Women are more emotional and subject to stress, so your utmost goal is to give them the comfort they deserve. Some coworkings for women style their spaces as spa salons. Spending a day at the spa where interior details appeal to five senses is tempting. 

Bring fresh green plants, art pieces, use calming colors, flavor the air with the scent of relaxing aromatic candles, play soft music in the background. Offer your guests fresh coffee, spa water, and snacks, along with comfortable seating arrangements. 

### Apply the Knowledge of Color Psychology to Appeal to Female Aesthetic Preferences    

Some colors are traditionally considered feminine. They appeal most strongly to women audience and are smart choices for marketing messages, websites, and interior designs targeting women. According to multiple color studies, favorite colors of women and men differ. 

Please note that the division of feminine, masculine, and gender-neutral colors is rather nominal. Colors come in so many tints and shades. So, if you strongly dislike dark green, you may love mint. There are no universally appropriate shades, yet some generalizations are possible.

#### What Colors to Choose for a Women-centric Coworking Space

![Spacious Coworking Space in Bluish Colors](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/gender-oriented-coworking-as-a-current-business-trend-3.jpg|height=1080,width=1920) 

Here is a brief recap of colors loved by women.

- **Blue** you can use both for male and female-oriented spaces. Both sexes and all age groups love it. Blue has a calming effect. The shades of blue particularly loved by women include cerulean, azure, baby blue, beryl, cornflower blue, robin's egg blue and sapphire.
- **Green** is one more unisex color favored both by men and women. Green is calm and restful, and it is associated with growth, renewal, health, and environment. The shades of green loved by most of the women are jade, beryl, leaf green, lime, mint moss, pine, sea green, seafoam, spring green, and viridian colors.
- **Blue-green** is also known as the turquoise. The color is a mix of two cool colors favored by women. Turquoise colors include aquamarine, aqua, cerulean, teal, and ultramarine.
- **Purple** us the color favored exclusively by women and strongly disliked by men. It is traditionally associated with royalty, spirituality, romantics, and mystery. Shades of purple are amethyst, eggplant, indigo, lilac, magenta, mauve, mulberry, orchid, plum, pomegranate, violet, and wine.
- **Lavender** is associated with genteel ladies and can evoke nostalgia or romance. Lavender includes shades of lilac, mauve, orchid, plum, and thistle.

#### Should I Design My Women-only Coworking Space In Baby Colors?

Color studies say that women prefer soft over bright colors. Does it mean that coworking for women should be all soft pastels or royal purples? No way! You should involve many more factors in selecting hues. Gender is only one consideration. Remember that a color that successfully targets young women in the USA turns into failure in Germany. 

So what should you do? Mind that feminine colors are not universal, research symbolism, preference, and psychological effect of certain colors and color combinations.

### Technical Side of Female Coworking Spaces

![Two Girls with a Laptop](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/gender-oriented-coworking-as-a-current-business-trend-4.jpg|height=1080,width=1920) 

Women go to coworking spaces not because of their eye-candy design. First of all, they go there to work. So, your coworking space must cover their primary professional needs.

Provide business ladies with every piece of equipment they require for everyday work. You must take care of everything, we mean from little things like staples and pens to bigger tools like printers and copy machines. It goes without saying that you must have a stable high-speed internet connection, landline telephones, and other office hardware gadgets.

#### Utmost Security

Demonstrate that you have high online and offline safety standards. Your customers don't want to worry about their data, business files, and other stuff. It must remain intact. Mount surveillance cameras, install anti-hacking software, develop procedures in case of data breaches. No matter how beautiful is your coworking space, no businesswoman will rent it if it's not trustworthy.
