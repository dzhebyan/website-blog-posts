Coworking business today has changed its values, priorities and marketing strategies. You can't just offer a desk and computer and expect that customers will stand in a line to book it. You need much more today to grab people's attention.

It goes without saying that furniture and hardware must match the highest tech and comfort standards. But it's just a tip of an iceberg. Modern coworking spaces are sooner business centers than workspaces. You can find everything an entrepreneur might need there, including accountant services, legal consulting, business training, and even fitness classes.

People consider price, location, and interior of your meeting room. Yet one of the reasons why people go to the coworking space is its special atmosphere, friendly supportive community and of course membership benefits.

If you want your guests to come back to your space every now and again, you need to demonstrate that being a member is beneficial. You can easily do it featuring cool things they could receive.

Build a solid membership benefit catalog to get more members and build a robust partner network. Read on to learn how to do it, what kind of benefits exist, how to organize them, allow members to gain access and other useful tips associated with coworking membership benefits.

## What Are Membership Benefits

What kind of members benefits do you use to attract customers to your coworking space? And what is the benefit of membership from your standpoint?

Traditionally, benefits for members of the coworking space are discounts, promo codes, or special offers that your members get exclusively from a third party partner. For example, an accounting company could offer a **20%** service discount for members of one coworking space. Amazon Web Services, Slack, even WeWork — all provide exclusive benefits. Ultimately, benefits are intangible advantages of your coworking space that make members happier.

## Why Is It Beneficial to Be a Member of Coworking Space

You need to educate your members on the advantages of being a part of the community.

- Members are always **aware of the latest news**. You can inform them about events, classes, offers, and so on via emails, newsletters, and push notifications.

- **Members get discounts** from third parties you partner with, which lets them save on food, workout, chillout, and other things.

- Members are invited to **participate in the events** carried out by the coworking space. This  is a strong magnet because a lot of coworkers struggle with loneliness and are happy to hang out with like-minded people.

- Members can conveniently book a meeting room via [corporate software](https://andcards.com/). You can integrate your coworking software solution with a [payment system](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/payment-system-for-a-coworking-space), [access control system](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/how-to-automate-access-to-a-coworking-space), whatever, and make the experience of your members even more enjoyable.

- You can implement [meeting room credits](https://andcards.com/blog/software/meeting-room-credits-at-a-coworking-space) and let members pay with them instead of money for booking. Needless to say how much people like to get services/products for free.

  But let's come back to the original topic of our blog post and get to know what kinds of benefits you can offer to your members.

## What Types of Benefits Exist

We have already mentioned above that current coworkings are aimed at supporting the professional growth of their members. They are striving to create perfect conditions for that and provide multiple additional services to facilitate development.

It will be natural to focus some coworking membership benefits on helping to achieve company goals. However, some of them may be just for fun, such as movie tickets or a free day at a yoga club.

Typically benefits fall in one of the following categories:

- Technology (AWS Activate, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, software outsourcing, dev tools).
- Growth (marketing service offers, sales tools, CRM, calling apps, SEO tools).
- Management (accounting service discounts, legal consultancy).
- Lifestyle (restaurant discounts, sports club perks, movie tickets, or just a free beer at a local pub).

### How to Build up Membership Benefits

Now, when you know what are membership benefits and what types of benefits exist, you probably want to know how can you build up those member benefits. This isn't too hard. Just reach out to local businesses and ask if they offer any discounts for new customers. Since you are giving them a free stream of customers, they should be interested. Higher value benefits like AWS or HubSpot CRM could require more effort to qualify.

## How to Organize Membership Benefits & Present Them to Members

When you have a killing list of membership benefits for your members, it's time to organize and present it.

Here are three points to consider if you want your members to take the most out of their status:

1. You need to place all benefits in a simple catalog that members can quickly discover.
2. To develop a way for members to request or send an application for the benefit of interest.
3. Think out a method of collecting applicants' information and forwarding it to benefit provider.

Luckily, you don't have to do all that manually. andcards Suite has a dedicated membership benefits section that automates the whole process.

It allows you to compile all available membership benefits on a dedicated Benefits section of andcards Suite:

### Additional Info Required to Create a Benefit

When creating a benefit, you need to provide the following information:

- **Title** — a name of the benefit.
- **Subtitle** that appears below the title in the list.
- **Description** of the benefit, along with the application process.
- **Category** to which the benefit belongs.
- **Language** of email confirmation messages.
- **Link** to a website where members can learn more about the benefit.
- **Visibility** of a benefit to members or guests.
- **Branches** in which the benefit will be visible.
- **Application allowance** (once or unlimited).
- **Application type** (by email, or no application necessary).
- **Provider email** to send applicant information.
- **Manager email** to let your team responsible for benefits know who applied.
- **Email confirmation message** — an instruction for the applicant to be included in the confirmation email. Could contain the promo code, other guidance on how to take advantage of the benefit, or just "We'll get in touch." message.

## How Members Can Apply for Benefits

![Create coworking membership apply](https://d7ccq1i35b0cj.cloudfront.net/andcards-benefits-apply-light-en-1920-1200.png|height=1200,width=1920)

When members open the benefit details page, they will see a big blue button to apply. In the application form, members indicate their contact phone number, email, as well as any comments. The phone number and email are auto-filled from a member's profile. If a member didn't type a phone number or email on their profile, they could manually type it on the benefits application form.

Upon successful application, a member, a benefit provider as well as a responsible person will receive an email confirmation. What's especially great is that it works with a white label. If your andcards Suite is customized with your coworking space brand, all application emails will contain your logotype. Bingo!

As most of your customers are active smartphone users, the whole process works perfectly well via mobile apps. So, it's safe to say that your coworking space members will always have benefits at their fingertips.

## Analyze Membership Benefits and Give Them What They Want 

One of the biggest advantages of an organized benefit application process is the ability to gather insights into which benefits people use the most. Use the `Download Statistics` button to download a detailed report on benefit applications. Analyze the report and get a deeper understanding of community members' aspirations. See the frequency at which this or that benefit is used. Know which categories are the most popular. Give members exactly what they want and need the most.

## Over to You

The takeaway from everything said above is that coworking membership benefits can become a weighty argument during the process of sign up. Those corporate goodies don't cost you a cent, yet give you a vantage over the competitors and contribute to the best UX at your space.
