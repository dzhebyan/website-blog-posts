This article is a kind of sequel showcasing five premium tools that will help you manage your growing business hassle-free. 

What happens when you scale? You expand. You might even open multiple coworking locations. While expanding you could get yourself lost and find it hard finding your overview. There are more suppliers to manage and more demand from potential members. 

When you scale it becomes a necessity to alter and automate your processes in order for you to work more agile, giving you more room to grow. These processes touch multiple areas of your coworking business such as lead generation (marketing), HR and finance. 

For some space owners keeping their cool becomes harder when their business grows. Setting up a roadmap that determines a long term vision can be daunting. But not with the right tools! 
The following tool-tips brought to you by SALTO KS are going to help you scale your coworking space like a breeze.

The communication tool can be integrated with several solutions like project management software. Collaborating on running a coworking project has never been easier when navigating through multiple, self-set-up channels where teams, even outside of your space, can share their essential info.

The nr. 1 tool for blogging and therefore attracting potential members to your coworking space(s) is [Medium](https://medium.com/).

Have your content marketing in check and make it a regular habit to post in order for you to become a thought leader and expert to your target audience and therefore grow your community.
