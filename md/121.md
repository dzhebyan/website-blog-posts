Oftentimes, coworking space owners try to avoid marketing strategies that seem complicated or obscure. SEO link building is one of those techniques. But I don't think it's a great tactic to stick your head in the sand as you are not an ostrich :-) You are a smart businessman using all available tools to market your space, grow its membership, and increase revenue.

Well, if link building is not in your marketing toolkit, today you will confidently add it there. 

Let's start with the basics.

## What Is Link Building 

You have probably heard this thousands of times but I am really going to keep things simple for you. When somebody is in the process of building links, it means that they are doing their bests to acquire hyperlinks from other websites pointing to their own resources.

Links are used to navigate between web pages on the internet. Bots use links to crawl the web—they use links to crawl individual pages on your website and crawl the links between entire websites.

SEO professionals agree that link building is one of the most challenging parts of digital marketing. There are many techniques for building links, that vary in difficulty. But one thing I can tell you for sure, if you master the art of link building, this will put you in **Google's top 10** and also ahead of the competition. 

## Why Your Coworking Website Needs Backlinks

Search engines use links in two fundamental ways: 

1. To discover new web pages.
2. To determine how high a page should rank in search results.

In plain English — search engines crawl web pages and extract their content to add it to their indexes. This is the way they decide if a page is quality enough to be ranked well for relevant keywords. 

Yet, it's not only page content that helps search engines make a decision. They also look at the number of links from external sources that point to that page. Thus, the more high-quality websites link to your coworking site, the more likely you are to rank high in search results.

Supposing all other factors are equal for your and your competitors' websites. In this case, the volume and quality of backlinks to your web pages will make the difference between rankings.

## Dofollow & Nofollow Links

Links can have "dofollow" and "nofollow" attributes, which makes no difference for the user, however, it does make difference for search engines.

```
<a href="" rel="nofollow">I love andcards</a>
```

By adding rel="nofollow" you are telling Google not to pass any PageRank across this link to the target URL, which means it will not help the target URL to rank any better.

*Why do websites add those rel="nofollow" attributes?* Because they want to keep all links coming from their resources in control. You can discover that your link is nofollow if you dropped it somewhere in:

- a blog comment
- forum post
- guest book comment
- editable Wikipedia page
- Yahoo! Answers
- guest post signature
-  paid ads

- press releases
- article directories
- advertorials.

Resources where users can freely add links save a heap of efforts with nofollow attribute as they don't moderate every single one of those links. They don't let link spammers get the advantage of a site's PageRank by choosing to apply the nofollow attribute to all links posted by other users.  

As you see, everybody has their reasons and they are fair enough. But does it mean that nofollow links are not worthwhile? 

> Nofollow links will not help your organic search rankings directly as dofollow links. Yet, users don't check whether a link is nofollowed and click it to visit your website. That is why you are buying advertisements online. For link building purposes, you, of course, want most of your links to be followed and therefore counted by Google.

Please note that a healthy link profile of a coworking website should contain both dofollow and nofollow links.

## What Is Link Profile   

The link profile of your corporate website is an assessment of all the inbound links it managed to earn. 

Normally, the link profile of your coworking website will be assessed by:

1. Total number of links.
2. Their quality (how many of them are spammy).
3. Diversity (are all your links from one site linking for a hundred times or are they from a hundred sites linking to you only once, and more.) 

Your link profile tells Google and other search engines how your website relates to other resources on the Internet. By the way, you can take a look at your link profile with the help of [one of the multiple SEO tools](https://ahrefs.com/backlink-checker) available on the market. 

New, when you know how powerful are backlinks, the temptation to manipulate them is strong, however, I don't advise you to do it. Gaining artificial links for the sake of search engine rankings increase is a dangerous tactic that contradicts Google's terms of service. 

Once you are caught, you get a serious punishment like deindexation of your website. In other words, some web pages or even the entire domain may be removed from search results. So, don't cheat, lie, or steal, try to keep your link profile clean through diligent, honest, hard work.

These sorts of links will show Google that your links and authority are being earned fairly:

- **Earned or editorially placed**. Your content is so awesome that sites want to link to it.
- Links are **relevant**, coming from topically similar websites.
- **Anchor text** of your links is descriptive and relevant, not spammy. With variations of the same anchor text, your chances to rank higher for a certain keyword increase. But exactly the same anchor text looks suspicious for Google.
- Links you are building **send qualified traffic** to your website. You should never build links to improve your Google rankings only. The right approach is to acquire links from relevant websites whose audience would also get value from your site content.


## Shady Link Building Techniques to Avoid

![Girl with stretched hand](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/link-building-for-coworking-business-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Google wants you to earn links, so you must avoid unnatural links or link spam to be safe from penalties. 

Here are some of the risky link building practices you should keep away of:

1. Purchased links.
2. Cross-linking/link exchange/reciprocal linking.
3. Links from low-quality directories.

## Characteristics of High-quality Links 

Use this recap as a checklist when analyzing the backlink profile of your coworking website:

1. Earned or editorial (which is the same).
2. From authoritative, relevant pages using a natural relevant anchor.
3. Growing over time.
4. Bringing qualified traffic to your website.
5. A healthy proportion of dofollow + nofollow.
6. Strategically targeted but earned naturally.
