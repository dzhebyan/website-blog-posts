You can find coworking spaces almost everywhere in the world. In **2007**, there were no more than **14** coworking spaces around the globe. In **2017** their amount exploded astronomically to **14 000** and counting. By **2022**, there will be at least **30 000** of them on the planet.

Such a booming venture should have huge profit, yet most of the coworkings have huge difficulties with profitability instead. Modern coworking is a venture that stimulates the stable growth of independent worker, praises flexibility and claims itself to be a creative workplace for new talents. But what does it say about itself as a profitable venture? We asked ourselves that very question — and started digging into that aspect.

There are different problems with management as well as with coworking activities — but one true pain for almost each and every coworking’s administrator is the chaos of meetings and bookings for meeting rooms.

------

Because of the limited space amount in a typical coworking environment, the main challenge is to use proper timing for working places, hot desks, conference rooms, and public coworking space. Lots of tasks create a real buzz for an administrator with lack of space (and time) for a proper booking management system. Yet without it it’s impossible to monitor meeting rooms for not being occupied for too long, not being overbooked or underbooked by residents and resident teams in coworking spaces.

Booking a meeting room in a coworking space can be a very stressful task none of your administrators would like to face with on a daily basis. Such a mess with booking process for meeting rooms can cost a fortune for a coworking reputation (as well as it can take lots of time and effort for your administrators).

*Great news is that there is certainly a way to change that.*

## How To Resque Coworking Management

![dog in superhero costume](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/how-to-automate-meeting-room-booking-in-a-coworking-space-1.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

What your coworking needs is a well-functioning management system. Problems with timing and bookings will repeat, and coworking’s manager should face them while being prepared. 

**And this is the time to conquer chaos in 5 steps:**

- **Check Up Your Meeting Rooms.** It’s time to go — to go around and find out how many meeting rooms are available. Knowing that will help you scheduling the meetings that will go on throughout the day. It can help with cutting down chaos with bookings. You should also connect your calendars to specific meeting rooms. Such an integration can assist with the scheduling and avoid mismatches in your internal schedule.
- **Check Up The Appliances.** Such a check-up for various meeting rooms will help you assigning different types of meetings in different types of spaces. If a meeting room has just a drawing board in it, you can’t hold a PowerPoint presentation there. And when a meeting room has a projector screen, laser pointer, Alexa or Google Home in it, it’s not rational to hold a brainstorm in there (because all you need for this is just a flipchart).
- **Calculate the Price of Non-Coworking Members Rent for the Space.** This helps you to estimate your billing for a non-resident per hour for booking a meeting room. This is necessary to avoid losing money on non-residential bookings of meeting rooms.
- **Connect Specific Coworkers and Their “Free Hours”.** Knowing the “free hours” of each coworker will help you with pinpointing their meeting schedule. This is the way to avoid sending coworking residents into meeting rooms when they’re occupied. They only schedule meetings for their free hours. Knowing this also helps you to estimate who is in the meeting room presently and how much the present hour and the next hour will cost.
- **Automate Your Routines.** The whole world is going online with software and apps. Staying offline will bring you no good at all. So let’s automate and get the best automation has to offer.
