![Garage Society coworking space Hong Kong](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/top-3-hong-kong-rise-garage.jpg|height=600,width=900)

The first one I would like to share with you is [Garage Society coworking space](https://www.thegaragesociety.com/hong-kong). Actually, it's "spaces", as Garage society is a network of coworking spaces around the world, and 4 of them are located in Hong Kong. When you see the photos of that coworking space, you can tell that cozy and nice workplace with all the amenities you need. But what you can’t see is a great community of people who are working there. Garage Society is not just a shared office, it’s a place where you can meet cool people with great ideas while working in a beautiful workspace.
