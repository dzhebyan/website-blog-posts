> "For DOERS Coworking, the **andcards application is ideal** for managing shared spaces and coworking. It is simple, visual, at a very competitive price and has all the necessary tools without overloading with data that is often not very relevant. It has an internal communication feed, the members are added easily and quickly. **I recommend it 100%**."
