This article features the best coworking podcasts to match your business, motivational, educational, and entertainment needs. Are you thrilled? You will be able to check them all in a moment.

By the way, do you use podcasting to promote your coworking business? 

## Benefits of Podcasting for Promotion of Your Coworking Business 

You probably know that podcasting is an efficient marketing tool. Businesses actively use podcasts to improve their authority, recognition, and revenue. Podcasts have replaced radio on mobile devices. Overall smartphone usage is one of the factors why podcasts experience explosive growth these days. Below we are going to recap key benefits podcasting can bring your coworking business. 

### Niche Business Podcasts as an Alternative to Videos

Video marketing can work wonders for marketing of your coworking space. However, not every video is suitable for the purpose. An amateur video of poor quality can even harm the reputation. So, if you don't know much about shooting and processing videos, it's better to opt for something simpler. 

By the way, video production requires at least semi-professional equipment which is not that affordable for most coworkings. You need to consider too many aspects that may go wrong when you shoot a video. They are — lighting, sound, background and so on. If it's too challenging even think about it, try to switch to podcasts.

### Reach New Audience with Coworking Podcasts Online

![A Black Man with Earphones](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/top-5-coworking-podcasts-for-everyday-listen-audio-marketing-tips-1.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Releasing regular podcasts online helps to reach out to the new audiences and discover new opportunities for business growth. Build relationships with prospective customers. They will subscribe to your podcast series and regularly listen to them. You are likely to keep your audience as long as the audio series continues.

The fans of your podcasts may share their impressions with friends, which will enormously expand your reach. This is a good way to quickly generate traffic to your online coworking resource. 

### Establish Trusted Relationships with Your Listeners

A podcast is a one-side medium, still, it helps to build friendly relationships with the listeners. People get the feeling that they know the person speaking on the podcast. The audience listens to the podcast when they have something in common with the speaker and are interested in the service he/she is representing.

This is a kind of interaction that helps to build trust. You involve listeners in the community and encourage them to be associated with the brand. This surely leads to conversion boost. People are more willing to use the service provided by a friend than a complete stranger.  

### How to Create a Coworking Podcast

Please don't worry, there are no long lists here. Not too many steps are associated with creating a coworking podcast. Necessary equipment is affordable and easily available. For creating your viral coworking podcast you only need [a microphone of decent quality and headphones](http://www.podcastinghacks.com/best-podcasting-equipment-package-on-a-budget/). The software for editing is simple and available for free. 

Additionally, you need a reliable WIFI connection to upload audio files on your web page and a corporate email to send them to your audience.

As soon as your podcast is ready you need to get maximum exposure for it. I can suggest you make it available on [popular distribution channels](https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-distribution-guide/).

### Will My Coworking Podcast be Engaging for the Listeners? 

This is a good question as nowadays people are overloaded by information. Why should they want to take in some more of it? Because you offer audio content, which is a fun break from the monotonous written one. Moreover, podcasts are emotional and interactive, the speaker can convey the message in a memorable way. No article, e-book or guide is that engaging, except for inspirational reading like [opinions of coworking industry leaders](https://andcards.com/blog/experts), maybe... 

Here is a killing fact for you:

> Internal Midroll surveys of 300,000 listeners found that 63% of people bought something a host had peddled on his show.

Here we can conclude that podcasts are highly engaging and can positively affect buying decisions.  

### Searching to Pump Your Public Speaking Skills? Look no Further!

When you start to create podcasts you forget the awkward moments of your former public speeches. Podcasting helps you raise the level of confidence. Natural, easygoing speech in front of the audience is not a dream anymore, it's a reality. Thanks to these performances you will be able to present and promote your coworking business much more efficiently. 

Now, are you ready to be inspired by others' coworking podcasts?
