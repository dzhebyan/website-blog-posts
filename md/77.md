Running a business today requires round-the-clock attention. The companies tend to hire a minimal number of employees, so most of the positions are presented with a single worker. When those irreplaceable employees go on vacation, there is nobody to take their responsibilities. The same applies to project managers and business owners.

But people need rest to avoid professional burnout, health issues, lack of inspiration, depression, and chronic fatigue.

Workation may be a compromising solution for people who need their job done under any circumstances. But not only for them. Managers encourage hard-working employees allowing them to take a workation and not show up at the office for some time. 

These are not all examples of cases when we can talk about workation, and this gives us the ground to dig deeper into the matter. In this article, we are going to discuss workation from multiple angles and find out how to entirely meet the expectations of people working on vacation.

## What Is a Workation    

Workation has become one of the fiercely debated topics. Some publications call it work and life balance, others object that workation has nothing in common with traditional retreat. 

I think everything depends on the person on workation, some really need help as they lost their ability to relax. They are scared to put their laptops aside not because they need to keep things in control or have an urgent unfinished task. They are just too anxious believing that things will go wrong as soon as they take away their eyeballs from the screen.

In truth, workation is not something meant to harm and the goal of coworking spaces targeted at people working on vacation is to provide the utmost comfort and technical support to facilitate the successful accomplishment of all the planned tasks. 

**But let's return to the definition.**

It's obvious that the term workation is a combination of “work” and “vacation”. People go on vacation but perform their routine tasks. When do they find time to do sightseeing? After work and on weekends. 

One of the peculiar characteristics of workation is timing. It is temporary. In a while, employees will go back home to their office work. Workation can last as long as agreed with the boss.

Workation is possible only for digital work. Modern employees and freelancers ask for flexible working hours and longer vacations, which can't make an employer happy. Though, a workation can become a way for an agreement. 

## Why People Go on Workation

Running coworking in the countryside you need to know your customers' motives to help them achieve their objectives.

Rural coworkings grow popularity because people see the following advantages in the workation:

- Landscape change as a way to get back inspiration and motivation. 
- The opportunity to take a look at the job from another perspective. 
- Relieve the stress without going on a holiday.
- Escape a rainy/cold/hot season and spend this time in comfortable weather conditions.
- Meet other people busy with the same business activities and learn new tricks from their experience. 
- Get acquainted with new cultures in a foreign country. 
- The opportunity for personal and professional growth.
- Become more productive.
- Make friends with teammates if several people go on workation together.
- Employers can use workation as a bonus for existing employees and one more attraction for those they want to hire. 
- Workation can become a kind of trial for those who are thinking to shift to remote work. 

Now let's see what drawbacks people on workation face and think how you, as a coworking in the village can address them.

- Unfortunately not every work can be digitalized and you can do nothing about it. People of certain professions (like doctors, police officers) don't qualify for workations.
- Sometimes people can't focus on work during their summer workation, which leads to failed tasks and disappointment in the whole philosophy. 
- People worry about additional expenses like flights, technology, visas, etc. Although they can save on living costs depending on the country of destination.
- The necessity to rearrange the working process. For instance, be able to take part in the meeting online instead of physical presence. 

You see, now you have a kind of customers' expectations and fears list. Take care of both and you'll win their hearts. 

## How to Set off on Workation 

There are two ways for a person to go on workation. 

1. Turn to professionals
2. Plan everything themselves

There are many organizations like [Remote Year](https://remoteyear.com/lp/imagine) (which you as coworking in countryside can partner) that arrange everything for groups and individuals on workation. The service starts with preparing arguments for the boss and goes further to organizing accommodation, meals, events, activities, connections, coworking, transfer to other destinations, and so on. 

In the second case, when an individual wants to save some money, they have to organize all the above themselves, which is a bit hairy. 

## How to Choose the Destination for Workation

![Exotic destination](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/coworking-in-the-countryside-for-those-who-need-to-keep-close-to-wifi-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Here we would like to highlight common people's considerations when they choose the destination for workation. Knowing them you can market your rural coworking more efficiently.
