Coworking space business is developing at the flashing speed. We observe one of the market laws in action — demand generates supply. 

New generation people are searching for life-work balance. They want the utmost flexibility of working hours, extended vacation, floating days-off, the possibility to work from different places, and many other conveniences only freelance job can give.

Coworking spaces with their powerful computers, all necessary office supplies, comfortable meeting rooms, and friendly community are great alternatives to traditional offices. 

However, the best coworking spaces offer not only a beautiful design, but they also provide futuristic user experience implementing cutting-edge coworking software. This software is loved by both members and managers. And this blog post is aimed at helping you choose the one that is perfect for your enterprise. 

## All-in-one Software VS Integrations? 

Current coworking software falls under two big categories. Some developers want to include as much functional as they can into their products. The other create integrations with the most popular apps you have got used to. 

At first, you are tempted to grab the first do-it-all software and breathe out. But I advise you not to make haste. The best solution is not necessarily the most obvious one.

**Consider this:** 

If you need to fix one of the PCs at your coworking space, do you hire a specialized professional or a handyman who says they can also fix electricity, paint the walls, check your sewerage?

No! Because you don't want to pay for additional services you don't need at the moment. Besides, a handyman doesn't look trustworthy enough to approach your last-generation hardware.

Am I right? Does the idea to purchase do-it-all coworking software still seem brilliant to you? After [reading this article](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/it-integrations-or-all-in-one-solutions-which-is-best-for-your-business), where all things are considered, it will be much easier to choose the category of software that fits your hub better.     

## How to Choose Perfect Software for Your Coworking Space? 

![Coworking space](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/9-best-apps-for-coworking-spaces-1.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

We have already discussed two categories of coworking software (integrations & all-inclusive). But these are not all the competitors in the market. 

Some entrepreneurs opt for custom solutions for their coworkings. It seems like a winning bargain as nothing can make you happier than software tailored to your needs. Though, when the developer starts to negotiate the cost of their work and further maintenance your hair starts to stand on end. 

And don't forget about compatibility issues. Imagine that you want to integrate the access control system into your coworking software. It's hardly possible to do it straight away if you have a custom one.

### A Bare Minimum of Features to Consider When Choosing a Coworking Management Software 

Today's coworking software provides an overwhelming set of features, from billing to tracking members. Those features can free the manager's hands by automating most of the processes. Though, it's not easy to decide which features you will use daily and which you don't want to pay for. 

Here is a list of items to take a closer look at when you are searching for the best deal. I included only vital functionalities a coworking management software should have, the rest are optional. I hope this narrowed list supplied with tips and advice will eliminate the guesswork and help you choose your coworking space management software with confidence.
