If you are thinking if it will be good to make your coworking a pet-friendly space, read this article. Learn the major benefits and challenges of this decision and take it wisely.

Do you know how many of your members have pets? I bet the percentage is **70** or even more. If you ask a dog owner how they feel about leaving the pup alone, most likely you'll hear something like that:

> _"I feel really bad about leaving Spot at home all day all alone. But I can't find a good dog-sitter. I wish I could bring my buddy with me to work."_

Many offices and workspaces change their "no pets allowed" policy nowadays and you can be one of those forward-thinking hubs. 

You know, a pet-friendly coworking space is a significant perk for members. Instead of leaving their furry friends home, members can bring their dogs to work and let them become part of the community.

**Do you worry that dogs will disturb some of the members?**

Indeed, dog-friendly coworking spaces are not for everyone. Some people prefer not to be around dogs. Some dogs are too active to lay at their owner's feet while they work. 

Your clientele may reduce a bit when you hang the sign "a dog-friendly space". However, it's not an issue for most of the pet-friendly coworkings as the number of people it helps retain outweighs any negative impact.

## Why Bringing Pets to Coworking Space

Having dogs as four-paws members of your coworking community can beсome a real pleasure. Here are main pros of the experience:

- **Feel at ease**. Modern people feel more comfortable with online chats than small talks face-to-face. Coming to the coworking space with a pet lets to avoid the awkward moments of polite  mini conversations about the weather and other insignificant stuff. Dogs help people feel free and approachable.
- **Boost creativity**. Pet owners believe that staying in the company of their pets facilitates better creativity flow. This happens because taking care of the dog fills your life with new sense, implies responsibility, which keeps mind sharp and active. The best thing about creative energy is that it can be shared with people within the same space. It's safe to say that pets inspire creativity. 
- **Efficient anti-stress and anxiety relieve.** Being a freelance entrepreneur gives you the freedom and flexibility unreachable when you work at the office nine to six. Though, being your own boss with all the self-organization often causes stress and anxiety. Pet owners have their backs covered here. All they need to calm down, regulate their heartbeat and blood pressure is petting a dog.  
- **Productivity increase**. This is a controversial point. Dogs always want attention, so they distract us from work. Yet, at the same time short breaks to walk the dog, play with it, and pet it during the day make us more productive as our brain gets a few minutes to recharge. During this short activities you free your back and legs from stress as well.  

## Tips for Owners Going to Make Their Spaces Pet-friendly

Running a dog-friendly coworking doesn't mean that you should turn your space into mess with dogs running everywhere. Here are some basic rules that will help to keep things organized. 

1. **Aggressive dogs are not allowed**. The dog must be social and get along well with other dogs and members. 
2. **Smelly, poorly groomed dogs are a no-go**. The dogs must know how to use the pot and be clean. 
3. **The dogs are not allowed to bark** in the coworking space. It's difficult to focus on work with barking dogs around and coworking is a workspace in first turn. 
4. **Members can't leave their dogs unattended**, they can't let their dog ramble around the space freely. Members must have their dogs with them all the time, wherever they go. 
5. Dog-friendly coworking spaces are for everyone, so some members may be afraid of the dogs. You must ensure that everyone in your space is safe. If not in the private office, **all dogs must be on leash** all the time when you are having members who are afraid of the dogs inside. 
6. **Prepare water bowls for dogs**. Most of dog owners bring their own bowls but when you have a bowl in the space, you show that it’s a dog-friendly environment that cares about resident pups keeping them hydrated.
7. A dog-friendly coworking space requires **additional cleaning**. Members must clean up after their dog. 
8. **Buy a no-marking spray** because if an area is marked by accident even a well trained dog will mark on it again. If some additional cleaning is needed, charge the member for cleaning crew services. 
9. **Buy doggy treats** and keep them at the front desk. Show members that their furry buddies are also welcome at your space.
10. **Make up dog policies and print them out**. When new member arrives, you can quickly walk them through the list in terms of the onboarding experience. Pet friendly coworking spaces need to make expectations easy to understand, remember, and follow. Those guides will help you make your meeting room cozy and membership-driven.

## Special Amenities of Dog-Focused Coworking Spaces

![A dog in a tent at the center of the room](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/pet-friendly-coworking-spaces-pros-cons-concerns-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

A dog friendly coworking space can go further than offering high-speed internet and desks. 

Here is a list of facilities your members will be happy about:  

- private offices;
- phone booths;

- quiet rooms;

- conference rooms;

- open coworking (open area with couches, TV, and hot desks);

- indoor and outdoor spaces for dogs to play in;

- staff to monitor the dogs;

- on-site grooming (cutting, nails trimming, baths, blowouts, brushing);

- daycare (when members need to leave the dog.)


Daycare may become a peculiarity of your coworking space and a secret marketing strategy at the same time. You can provide daycare as a separate service. Customers will get more familiar with your space, see that their dogs like the facilities, and one day they’ll come to use the coworking. This is your chance to convert daycare clients into coworking members.

> **Side note:** A good [coworking space management software](https://andcards.com/) will help you run your pet-friendly zone more efficiently. Collect information about members and their pets, provide comfy room booking, notify members about events they can participate in with their dogs (e.g. fun charity runs), inform about benefits (e.g. discounts on dog grooming services, food), etc.  

## The Community Behind Dog-friendly Community 

Knowing your target audience is crucial for business revenue. So does the demography of a dog-friendly coworking space differ from the one of regular enterprise? Not really. Usually coworking community includes digital creatives, freelancers, remote workers, independent entrepreneurs, a mix of everyone. 

If you want to launch a dog-focused coworking it is likely to attract entrepreneurs running pet related projects. It's so natural to work on a dog project in the dog-friendly space.

## The Biggest Concern of Dog-friendly Coworking Owners

What is your biggest concern that stops you from announcing that dogs are welcome in your space together with their owners? Do you think it will be too noisy? Fair enough.

When you don't separate spaces, there will be noise. But people who come with their dogs anticipate something like that. 

If your place is nice people that are turned off at the beginning, later fall in love with it. You don't mind small inconveniences (especially the expected ones) if everything else is great.
