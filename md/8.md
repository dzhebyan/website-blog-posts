If you care about your coworking brand image and persistently work on improving brand recognition, you probably want everything somehow related to your company to bear its unique style. You surely have your branded domain address but what about the apps you use. Wouldn't it be cool to have a custom domain address for your [coworking space management software](https://andcards.com/)? andcards has got you covered here.     

## What Is a Custom Domain Name

Most coworking business owners start safe, with zero investment `https://<your-workspace-tag>.andcards.com` domain. But is this the best option for you? If you are going to scale your coworking empire and build a career in the coworking niche, it's worth to consider another variant.

Did you choose a self-hosted website? Probably yes because a self-hosted resource is the best bet for those who are looking to make money from coworking.

And what about a custom domain name?

When you sign up for andcards.com your domain name by default looks like this:

- *yourcoworking.andcards.com*

If it's ok for you, you can just continue using this domain name. But for some highly-professional coworkings, this type of domain does not fit.

Many startup coworking spaces decide to use the default domain name at the beginning. They think it's never too late to change the domain name when their business will become stable, when they will have more members, etc., etc. 

But if you want to know my opinion, that’s not always true. When you are building a brand, there is no point in procrastination. Be consistent and professional in everything you do. A custom domain name will become one more **trust signal** for your existing and prospective members.

## Why Is It Beneficial to Have a Custom Domain Name for Your Coworking Software

In this section, I am going to draw some more arguments in favor of custom domain name for your coworking space management app.

- With a custom domain name, you get **better exposure in search engines**. Google, as well as other search engines, prefer to link to root domains.
- It's much **easier to publicize** your app with a custom domain rather than having to say a long name.
- Root level domains are much **more trustworthy** in the eyes of users. If you are trying to make money running a coworking business, you’ll have a much easier time with a custom domain.

Perhaps the most important takeaway here is that having a custom domain you will have a brand name right from day one.

Just think about the situation like this—you have started with the domain name *yourcoworking.andcards.com*. Then you want to change it to *space.mycoworking.com* or similar. The name is completely different, so the process will be as if you are creating a whole new brand.

Well, in your case, you are getting this info now, so instead of waiting, you can grab a top-level root domain right from the start.

Normally, andcards coworking app is available to access from `https://andcards.com` or `https://<your-workspace-tag>.andcards.com` address. In some cases, however, you may want to introduce your own brand to the portal and use a custom URL and logo. In this article, I will explain how to set up your existing domain name such as `https://members.mycoworking.com` with [andcards white-label software](https://andcards.com/blog/software/what-is-white-label-for-coworking-software).

## Set up DNS

If you're reading this, chances are you already have a marketing website available at `https://mycoworking.com`. Since the root domain is already taken by your homepage, we need to create a "subdomain" that'll lead your members to andcards. For example, you can choose `https://members.mycoworking.com` or `https://portal.mycoworking.com` — it could be any word!

Then you'll need to associate your subdomain with andcards. The exact instructions depend on your website provider. In general case, it looks like this:

1. Open your domain DNS Control Panel. Usually, it's available on the site where you bought the domain name. In some cases, however, it may have been delegated to another service that hosts your data.

2. Create a new CNAME record pointing to `ssl.andcards.com`. If you use `AWS Route 53` it will look like this:

![custom domain mapping to website](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/custom-domain-example-aws.png|height=914,width=1440)

## Over to You

Summarizing everything said above, a custom domain name is the very own and personal URL of your coworking brand. Many entrepreneurs when starting out their coworking business do not know the advantages of a custom domain name. Unknowingly they do not realize what they are missing out on.

Besides, a custom domain name instantly boosts your coworking brand credibility. Serious businesses prefer working with companies that have personalized URLs.

Furthermore, when you are using a custom domain name it increases the visibility in your field. It also gives you the opportunity to promote your space effectively as a brand.
