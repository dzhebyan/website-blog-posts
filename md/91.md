It doesn't matter how old are you, most of us love Halloween. Traditionally All Hallows Eve is associated with orange and black, pumpkin grins, dreadful costumes, fests, carnivals, parties, frightful treats, sweet candies, in a word — lots of fun.  

> *“Halloween is the only time people can become what they want to be without getting fired.”*
> ― **Sylvester Stallone**

Are you going to miss all this cheer in your coworking space? No way! Let your members enjoy one of the greatest perks of the remote work, the freedom, and the informal atmosphere. If you are struggling to build community, friendship, encourage collaboration within your space, **Halloween 2019** is your chance.

Let your members feel themselves a part of something bigger than just a desk at your space, maintain relationships. This way you will increase retention, loyalty, and grow coworking community along the way. And my goal is to give you some winning ideas of organizing a terrific Halloween party at your coworking space.      

## Why Celebrating Halloween at a Coworking Space

While you are trying to figure out whether to organize a happy Halloween party at your coworking space and how business and members can benefit from it, I'll give you some reasons for turning the enterprise into a haunted house for a few days.

- You can **impart the event a bigger sense**. Some coworking spaces do efficient fundraising during such holidays and donate those funds to charity organizations later. I am sure members will be happy to support this initiative. In the end, all of you will feel great because you help those who are in need all together.   
- It's difficult for adult people to **make friends**. Yet, coworking experience becomes really cool when you can just turn to a person sitting at the next desk and tell them a joke, laugh together, etc. Coworking Halloween will help members to know each other better and feel at ease when they meet next time.
- Show members the **other side of your brand**. This is the time when you don't need to be serious. Be creative and give members topics to discuss on socials. Refer to murder, gore, and evil spirits creating your holiday emails, press releases, social media posts, whatever.  This is the only day when you can get away with this.     

> Creepy Crawly Cocktail Party😈
>
> Apocalypse Party — Come to Dance on the Bones☠️
>
> Mad Space Masquerade👻
>
> Trick-or-Tequila🎃
>
> Blood-Spattered Ball🦇

- Ask your members to contribute with ideas for your coworking Halloween party 2019 or even help with preparations. **Group planning** makes people more committed to the event. Involve members in the process. Even a simple poll where you ask them how they want to celebrate coworking Halloween will help to establish connections and meet community expectations.

It's not necessary to invent something totally new to amaze your members. You can use **time-tested approaches**.

For instance: 

- Transform one of your meeting rooms into a movie theatre and invite members for a **horror movie**. Don't forget about popcorn, drink, and candy. 
- Coworking members are usually geeks loving computer games. There is no lack of bloody **zombie shooters**, isn't it? You can recruit your local desperados for a night fight mission aimed to clear the city from rotten.    
- Carry out a competition of **villain costumes**. Make your members internet celebs featuring their pics on your resource and letting the community vote for the most ghastly ones.    

## Tips on Organizing a Coworking Halloween Party

This section includes some tips to follow if you want to make your coworking party something that members will remember.

- Everything starts with a **guest list**. This is important as not all of your members will come. Some prefer to celebrate at home or need to take kids to trick or treat. Include only members who confirmed their participation and cater snacks and beverages accordingly.
- Take care of **Halloween-themed food**. You can call the snacks creatively: *Frog skulls, Spider legs, Fingers of the dead, Witchy brew, etc*. Remember of those who don't eat meat and don't drink alcohol, serve vegetarian snacks and non-alcohol drinks.
- **Decorate your hub properly**. Halloween is one of the holidays that are impossible without spooky decorations. Your space must look like a haunted house with spider webs, Jack-o-lanterns, bats, candles, broomsticks, and so on. Horrifying desktop wallpapers and blood-freezing music in the background will add a final touch to your space transformation.
- Encourage members to wear **killing costumes and makeup** as you are building the space especially for vampires, demons, witches, goblins, werewolves, and other undead.
- **Involve members that don't come to the party** as well. Your coworking Halloween is for everyone. Some members are shy to come to the party, some simply can't come because of other essential business, however, they can participate in the online competitions. For instance: *"The most mysterious story that happened in my life."* 
- **For members having kids** you can arrange a day-time fun *"Bring your kid to work on Halloween."*                  

- **Set up good communication**. Of course, coordinating the events like your Halloween party requires information sharing. The best way to send mass emails, then reminders and notifications is through your [coworking space management software](https://andcards.com/). Modern apps seamlessly integrate with your favorite email services, like Mailchimp and you can continue to use it.
