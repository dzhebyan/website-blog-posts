Established in 2016, Seoul Global Startup Center (SGSC) is supporting starting entrepreneurs in Seoul specifically focusing on foreigners. The place has two floors and two types of membership. A "**resident membership**" is for startups accepted into accelerating program, which offers a free office for one year on the third floor, equity-free money grant, opportunities to pitch to investors and free coffee ‚òïÔ∏è.

Since the Center is funded by Seoul city government, the membership at Seoul Global Startup Center is free. Simple registration process gives you renewable three-month access to a coworking facility.

**Startup education programs.** SGSC invites different professional speakers that offer lectures on topics requested by resident startups. Coworking members can access those lectures as well. When I visited the place, there was a lecture on digital marketing basics by Christopher Shin, Chief Strategy Officer at Publicis Media and Grain bar Agency. The place also has a group of professional mentors, who give guidance to new entrepreneurs.

**Networking opportunities.** Coworking members can join networking events and get to know resident startups and fellow coworkers. At their events, you can meet resident startups like [Almond Studio](http://almond-studio.com), [VR Comet](https://www.vrcomet.co.kr/), [Imagga](https://imagga.com/), and many others, that have already gained recognition by Korean market and public.

**Supreme amenities.** Hyundai Card Studio Black definitely gives you a full package of tools to flesh out your ideas. Moreover, among few of 24 hours a day coworking spaces in Seoul, only here we were able to find shower rooms. Some have resting areas, but this place recognizes that working overnight should not affect how fresh and presentable its members look.

**Conect&Learn.** Hyundai Card encourages network and synergy among members through knowledge-sharing and coaching programs like Hyundai Card Class, Happy Hour, Job Fair, I'm Chef, and Invitation Lunch.
