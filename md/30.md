Coworking space in Seoul Startup Hub provides 234 seats on the first two floors on first come, first served basis. However, the atmosphere is not cramping at all due to spacious and bright interior. You can find regular desks as well as something more fancy like an area with small couches in front of a whiteboard to brainstorm your ideas. On the second floor there is an area with a playful steel slide, egg chairs, and cone couches. Essentially, you most certainly can find a corner for your own taste.

At the same time, you should be ready that everything is in Korean language, and staff has a somewhat limited English skills, so it might be hard to navigate the gigantic space. However, the fact that it's free, spacious and full of interesting corners, well outweights any possible discomfort that may be caused by lack of English signs.

Campus Seoul has three zones: Garden, Event Area, and Coworking Cafe. There is also a separate area for startups accelerated by Campus Seoul.

Cafe area strikes attention with a variety of extravagant light sources, exciting design elements, plants, and a great playlist. Drinks and snacks are affordable, especially for the Gangnam area (expensive business area in Seoul). If you want to work at the cafe, try to arrive earlier, as it is a popular area with minimal seats. Deep into the coworking, you will find call rooms that you can reserve at the spot 📋, which isn't as convenient as booking with a [meeting room booking app](https://andcards.com).

Overall there are around 100 seats, so it's spacious and full of friendly people. If you are short on budget or just looking for a quick working spot, check out Campus Seoul.
