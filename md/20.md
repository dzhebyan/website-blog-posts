The main problem for modern coworking space is that potential customers are not well aware of the very existence of such places. In order to become recognizable among the number of places in which freelancers get used to work, you’d need to take some steps for your own online visibility. And here is the moment where the best ways to promote coworking spaces can be useful for you. [Coworking software](https://andcards.com) for more flexible and effective work is one of them — but let’s also talk about other opportunities.

**How Can You Make Your Coworking Space Popular Online?**

First, you’d need to **split your promotion activities into two groups:**

- **Direct promotion methods:** through online advertising, sponsorship and search engine promotion. This is related to online ads only and requires mainly some SEO / SMO skills and money investment.
- **Indirect promotion methods:** by promoting your coworking space for online users. This requires time investment — but it can work out as the best way in some cases and word-of-mouth marketing works definitely more effectively than buying Google Ads for all the money you have.

**Start With Link-Building**

You should also consider link-building as one of the most long-term ways to become a popular expert in coworking space world:

- **Using resource link building:** this way of promoting your website means promoting only those articles and types of content which can be really useful for the audience interested in coworking spaces.
- **Implementing distribution of visual content:** infographics and visuals you’ve created can be then distributed through blogs and websites writing about coworking spaces which are interested in high-quality content with fresh numbers and facts about coworking industry.
- **Creating and publishing white-books / handbooks and user guides:** creating comprehensive guides for coworking space residents and managers can become a source of constant interest and receive a high ranking with search engines.
- **Establishing guest posts and online content partnerships:** you can promote your experts and opportunities which your coworking space provides for freelancers and entrepreneurs via guest posts in the blogs of companies or startups which work for coworking space managers or residents.
- **Using popular keywords and implement link earning** as a part of content strategy for the blog of your coworking space: you should consider ranking for low-competition industry-specific terms.

**Use Online Ads — But Do It Wisely**

If your coworking space is already well-known, but you still want to attract new resident groups in certain regions or city / country where your coworking space or network of spaces is located, you should consider online advertising. There are several ways to do it:

- **Google Ads or Google Display Network ads**: however, this method has its drawbacks: while your network of coworking spaces grows, the volume of ad budgets increase as well, and thus, your paid online ad campaign would result in significant added costs that won’t pay off with new leads and customers.
- **Facebook Ads**: this is good if your target audience consists of Facebook power-users. You can start campaigns even with $10 budget — and Facebook provides a step-by-step guide to promote almost any post on your coworking space page.
- **Alternative promotion tools**: if you own medium-sized or small-sized coworking spaces and you’re concerned about budgeting and balanced spending, you should try some alternative tools for promoting your services among the online audience.

Let’s consider some of the alternative PR tools as your next step for promotion of your coworking space.

**Creating Events In Social Networks**

If there's something happening in your coworking space, people should know about it — the more who know, the better. There are several improvements which you should make while creating events on Facebook:

- Start by inviting your colleagues, acquaintances and friends to take part in these events as WoM (word-of-mouth) provides more coverage than just targeting your ad to reach the “not-very-much-interested” audience.
- You can make these events popular by creating online contests with the tickets to the events as giveaway prizes for the winners. The more there are new guests, the more the potential residents and visitors who would want to come back to your space again.
- You should ensure the logistics and timing of the events are ideal and your coworking space’s staff are attentive, friendly and ready to help new visitors.

Positive impressions about your space from the comments of those who visited will be widespread across Facebook, Twitter or other social networks which sometimes works better than paid ads.

**Adding Your Coworking Space To Online Lists and Catalogs**

There are websites which gather information on popular coworking spaces and share them to the online audience: it’s usually blogs and websites dedicated to digital nomads, freelancers working remotely as well as online media about tech, startups and remote work-life. These websites regularly compile and update their lists of popular coworking spaces in certain countries.

You should contact the admins or representatives of such websites or blogs to fill them in about your coworking space and thus, have it added to their list.

However, there’s a simpler option — you can **add your coworking space to the list of coworking spaces** in [Coworker.com](https://www.coworker.com/) which is a large international directory of coworking spaces.

**Working Harder On Search Engine (SEO) And Social Media (SMO) Optimization**

If your coworking space has a regularly updated website, you should find out if your website meets the criteria for search engine optimization (SEO).

Alternate image captions, image descriptions, search phrases and keywords, properly hash-tagged pages, titles, subtitles, texts, and media content helps in giving your site a significant boost among search engines.

After all, when a website is SEO optimized, it ranks higher on Google search page results.

The same is true for Facebook, Twitter, Yelp and LinkedIn as the use of hashtags, high quality images and original texts relevant to the target audience gives your content wider reach on social media.

**Creating Separate Landing Pages For Those Who Have Not Become Your Customers Yet**

You should create a landing page with service offerings for individual freelancers or teams looking for coworking spaces in your area.

Landing page promotions and creation of these popular one-page websites with a fast 1-click-to-get buttons and forms for instant seats booking in your coworking space would be a good tool in strengthening your major ad or SEO campaign.
