As we detail in our article "[What Is a Coworking Space?](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/what-is-a-coworking-space)" there are many kinds of coworkings: shared offices, mixed spaces, accelerators, incubators, community spaces, etc. Sometimes it can be hard to figure out what you need especially for a freelancer, who wants to escape from home routine and find a great workspace atmosphere without distraction. üßò‚Äç All you need is a comfy chair, a pleasant environment and good people around. For such people, andcards prepared a digest of coworking spaces in Seoul which are perfect for a freelancer or a small team to work.

MY WORKSPACE 2 is located right next to the Gangnam subway station exit No. 1 an has a stunning view over busy streets of the Gangnam district. The atmosphere is quite light and relaxing, with soft music playing in the background and friendly staff who is ready to help. The MY WORKSPACE 2 coworking does belong to the same network of coworking spaces as MY WORKSPACE 3 mentioned in our [top coworking spaces in Korea](https://andcards.com/blog/archive/top-coworking-spaces-in-korea) article.

This coworking space pays a lot of attention to the needs of its customers. Since the most of them are Korean, who prefer their own space and maintaining privacy, MY WORKSPACE 2 is mainly composed of small offices and a handful of fixed seats. Such a modest size is not a disadvantage for members as there is less rotation of random people who might visit one of your neighbors.

### Benefits

- **Prices.** MY WORKSPACE 2 has one of the most affordable rental options in the area.
- **Rooftop.** A wonderful rooftop area of the coworking space with a great view of Gangnam's busy streets and all necessities for a great afterwork bbq party.
- **Personal approach to members.** It might be hard to be heard if you are part of a big coworking space with hundreds of members. The small size of MY WORKSPACE 2 allows them to remain flexible and provide more to their residents.

### Final Notes

The place is humble in size and reflects Korean style of coworking that doesn‚Äôt have large open coworking areas. The location is for those who need a small and straightforward office in the Gangnam area for a reasonable price without the need to put a great lease.
