Coworking space owners work on the design of their premises striving to create a perfect environment for members. Progressive entrepreneurs community tends to futuristic interiors supplemented by hi-tech gadgets. Here both hardware and software matter. [Coworking space management software](https://andcards.com/) offering meeting room display functionality is one of the elements that can help you impress your visitors and boost their experience.

In this blog post, we are going to talk about **meeting room display**. You will get to know what it is, what can it do for your coworking space, who can use it, and how to implement the system in your coworking space.

## What is Meeting Room Display

Meeting room display is a simple smart feature of andcards coworking software aimed to display a room's status. It is available for iOS and Android. So, you can place a tablet with a meeting room display on in front of the workspace for members' reference. The display will show if a particular room in a particular workspace is occupied or free at the moment, what is the ongoing meeting progress, and what time it will be available for the new booking.

### How Meeting Room Display Improves UX at Your Space

Imagine the situation. During the meeting, one of the businessmen goes out because he gets an important phone call. He needs to arrange another meeting and a person on the other side is waiting for the time and place. How can he check the room availability if coworking software can't be accessed at the moment (he is talking over the phone.)

It's really easy if you provide tablets with meeting room display mode on. A busy entrepreneur quickly checks meeting room availability without interrupting the call, agrees about a business meeting and books a room immediately after he finishes the call. Not bad seems like you have considered everything.

andcards coworking management software includes a plethora of usable features and meeting room display is one of them. It serves to display meeting room availability, exactly as I have described above. The functionality comes as an integral part of the main software and is absolutely free to use for all andcards customers.

### How it Works

If you subscribe for andcards and want to place tablets in front of the meeting room to enable all your members to see the current status of the room, you just activate the relevant mode from the *Bookings* page of the app. Tap the button next to the (i) icon at the right top corner.

If you want to add an extra layer of security to the default settings, you can restrict access to one app only on the tablets displaying meeting room status. Here's how to do it for iOS and Android.

#### Why is Meeting Room Display an Awesome Feature

Thanks to meeting room display members can:

- Check room availability without using their phones **at a distance** with a highly visual room display app. 
- Know if a room is **free right now** for an important meeting.
- See **upcoming reservations**.

The meeting room display shows events in real-time. So, if you made a booking in andcards it will be instantly displayed on the room display.

Just think about the image-making wow effect the technology will make on the coworking space members, especially when enhanced by other smart integrations like [automated access control](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/how-to-automate-access-to-a-coworking-space). Nobody will ever compare your coworking software with Google calendar. The calendar simply can't do it.

## How to Implement Meeting Room Display in Your Coworking Space

The best thing about our meeting room display feature is its free availability for all andcards customers. This makes it even easier for you to add a futuristic touch to your coworking space environment. Here are a few simple tips that will help you make up your mind.

You don't need much to display the status of your meeting room. Actually, it all boils down to electricity supply and a tablet.

### Choosing a Tablet

There are no specific requirements to the tablet except bright display and minimum operating system of Android 6+ or iOS 9+. So you can opt for a budget one. Here are a few variants to consider.

We start with the most expensive option.

#### iPad Pro (11 inch) — a tablet for luxury coworkings.

![andcards Kiosk on iPad Pro tablet meeting room display](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/meeting-room-display-software-andcards-kiosk-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Price: $680-750 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K375GV4), [Apple Refurbished](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad)

The iPad Pro 10.5 has a huge bright screen and minimal bezels. Your meeting room display will be a visual treat. This most expensive tablet on our list will complement your high-end interior. Super thin bezels make it look like a meeting room display of the future.

#### iPad (9.7 inch) — a standard choice.

![andcards Kiosk on iPad 9.7 tablet meeting room display](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/meeting-room-display-software-andcards-kiosk-3.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Price: $300-350 on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Apple-9-7-inch-128GB-Wi-Fi-Space/dp/B01M06SGWM/ref=sr_1_1_sspa), [Apple Refurbished](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad)

The iPad 9.7 is a great meeting room display we recommend for most workspaces. The screen is just a perfect size, big enough to fit the availability text and upcoming schedule. The screen brightness is not as high as iPad 10.5, but still reasonably bright and legible from afar. The iPad 9.7 is also well designed aesthetically and will fit most of the interiors. There are white and black color versions for all tastes.

#### Lenovo Tab 4 (8 inch) — the budget option on our list.

![andcards Kiosk on Lenovo tablet meeting room display](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/meeting-room-display-software-andcards-kiosk-4.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Price: $50-100 on [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com/p/14006054916)

[Lenovo Tab 4](https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/tablets/android-tablets/lenovo-tab-series/Lenovo-Tab-E8/p/ZZITZTATB48) offers us low-end specs at a low price. This is a good choice if you're just getting into the meeting room displays and want to try the concept out. Lenovo Tab is also a price-conscious choice that won't require a huge investment if you have a lot of meeting rooms. The screen is a bit small and not that bright, but at this price point, you can't complain. You will not be able to read the text from far away, only up close. There are many versions of Lenovo Tab 3, so **make sure the tablet you buy can be upgraded to Android 6.0**.

### Installing a Tablet at a Meeting Room

We advise you to **plan the placement of the tablets beforehand** because it's not that easy to fit them in the existing minimalist hi-tech interior after all design works are finished.    

Think about the electricity supply to plug the tablets because there is no point in gadgets with a low battery charge. Some coworking spaces experiment by placing a tablet into a pocket, hoping it will last all day on a battery charge. Usually, it is a bad idea, because the always-on screen draws battery so fast that it will only last for a few hours. 

It is best to through a power line leading up to the tablet from the floor or ceiling. Usually, it's possible to drill a hole in a door frame and hide a wire inside it. 

The market of meeting room displays is very new, and there are new solutions that don't require power. For example, Vobot's [e-ink digital signage system](https://getvobot.com/) can last for about **a year on a single charge**. Cool, huh? 

## Over to You

Now, when you know what is meeting room display, what is it aimed at and what will it cost to implement it in your coworking space, the first thing you probably want to do is give it a try.
