"Oppa Gangnam Style!" says the most recognizable Korean song. Having arrived in Korea's capital city Seoul, you will most likely visit the iconic Gangnam station. Sprawling with highrise buildings, thousands of shops and restaurants, Gangnam has many great coworking spaces to recommend, including MY WORKSPACE, a perfect coworking space located just outsize subway exit #5. Take a turn right towards an A+ Asset Tower and lift yourself to the 12th floor. The coworking space has everything you need: a large hot desk zone with a perfect view of Gangnam's busy streets, unlimited supply of coffee, high-speed internet, massage chair, and best of all, unexpectedly affordable pricing.
