These days coworking spaces are undergoing a great transformation. This happens because of changing members' priorities. People coming to a coworking space today expect much more than just a desk for rent. They are waiting to immerse in a special environment that will feed their creativity helping to achieve the most daring professional goals. While doing that, they don't want to feel lonely, so collaboration and support are also essential.

In this article, I am going to showcase some of the best coworking spaces from all over the globe that managed to create really inspiring workplaces. You will learn more about their amenities and designs.

## What Makes a Coworking Space Better Alternative to Traditional Office?   

Thinking about the reasons for the growing popularity of coworking spaces, culture and experience seem to be the most obvious ones.

### The Sense of Connection

Popular coworking spaces have their unique culture and vibe. Friendly atmosphere and connection with other members are the top reasons why people join coworking spaces.

However, the community does not just appear all of a sudden. This is something space managers must take care about. 

Members are free to choose when and how they interact with each other. For instance, some like to have chats in the café or coffee bar. If a member wants to stay alone and concentrate on the work, they can do just that.

Coworking gives members opportunities to build professional relationships and grow their businesses. They interact with other members, connect with people who might be useful to their business—suppliers, contractors, potential clients, and business partners.

### Flexible Schedule

A good coworking is open **24/7** for members. Freelancers make up their work schedules according to individual biorhythms and lifestyles. 

If somebody needs a break, they just stand up and go to the break room to play a game, climb a wall, or just relax and come back to their desks when feel refreshed. Nobody needs to pretend to be working because the big boss is watching.

### Learning from Others

![Man presenting](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/most-inspiring-coworking-spaces-all-over-the-world-1.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Interaction inside the coworking community builds a high-speed highway to increased opportunities for innovation and collaboration.

For example, a person working in a different field can help to look at the situation from another perspective. This is a chance to come up with new, innovative solutions that would never cross freelancer's mind otherwise.

When a person works from home or office, their learning opportunities are limited. At a coworking space, they interact with other entrepreneurs, learn from their experiences, and share challenges with them.

This is perfect for growing business, learning from businessmen who are in different stages of building their businesses decreases the time needed to succeed, and minimizes the number of costly mistakes and pitfalls.

In addition, sometimes managers at the coworking spaces have enough knowledge to offer some useful advice and guide members in the right direction.

### Designed for Comfort and Wellbeing 

While traditional offices are designed for work without distractions, coworking spaces are welcoming and positive, with great ambiance and a feeling of wellbeing.

Coworking spaces pay a lot of attention to the interior design with plenty of natural light, break out spaces, lounges and cafes, and even gyms and workout zones.

In other words, everything inside a coworking space is meant to enhance members’ energy, inspiration, and motivation.

### Focus on Personal Growth

It is almost impossible to stay relaxed and behave naturally in a traditional office. That's why an employee's personality has to literally break into pieces—a real personality & an office alter ego.

This happens due to the competition with workmates, office policy, angry bosses, and many other things. Creating an office persona that deals with everyday issues is exhausting.

In a coworking space, there is no competition & office policy, so members can work for themselves only. Coworking culture allows to be relaxed and have fun while being yourself and doing meaningful work.   

### Join Your Tribe

Modern coworkings go even further in tailoring their spaces to the requirements of their customers. Want to come with kids? [Family coworking](https://www.wiggleandwork.com/) is supplied with safe playgrounds and provides professional nannies, which gives moms an opportunity to close all urgent tasks.

Don't want to leave your dog at home all alone? Take it with you into a [pet-friendly environment](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/pet-friendly-coworking-spaces-pros-cons-concerns) with water bowls, treats, and skilled groomers.

Need a female-only space? Come to [gender-oriented coworking](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/gender-oriented-coworking-as-a-current-business-trend) with its supportive community, healthy food, nice interiors, beauty and wellness facilities, and much more.

It seems like there is a space for people of every profession, like [culinary coworking](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/eat-live-cowork-food-coworking-spaces) or [coworking for techs](https://andcards.com/blog/experts/interview-xavier-bertschy-owner-urbanfish-coworking-biel-bienne-switzerland), for example. It's good to be around people who are thrilled about similar things, have the same vocabulary, and understand your jokes. 

Digital nomads and freelancers getting inspiration from studying foreign cultures can always find their cozy workspace in some [rural coworking](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/coworking-in-the-countryside-for-those-who-need-to-keep-close-to-wifi). The host will help to make the most of the workation. Advise what to see, where to go, who to network, what events to attend, etc.       

## Special Amenities Offered by Best Coworkings

![Women in the gym](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/most-inspiring-coworking-spaces-all-over-the-world-2.jpg|height=1080,width=1920)

Most of the decent coworking spaces have more or less the same set of amenities. But the best coworkings go beyond the standards offering something on top to let members feel their care every step they go.  

- A variety of **caffeinated and non-caffeinated beverages**. Having fresh water and coffee is ok but not enough for some members. People have special drinking habits during the day. Some prefer to keep away from caffeine. Details are important. Seeing a favorite drink on the menu list may make somebody's day.    
- A variety of **snacks**. Some of your members are happy with chips and individually sized snacks, while others need fresh fruit, healthy food, and freshly squeezed juice. Proper nutrition is very important for productivity, energy, and mood, so some coworkings go as far as hiring a culinary concierge to make tasty treats for their members.
- **Access control system**. You can easily solve the issue with 24/7 access to your coworking space with the help of modern [coworking software](https://andcards.com/). Let your community managers sleep at night. Their presence is not necessary. Coworking management software integrated with the [access control system](https://andcards.com/blog/tips/how-to-automate-access-to-a-coworking-space) will take care of members' safety and convenience.    
- Both **wireless and wired internet**. High-speed internet is a must for coworking spaces. Provide a wired and wireless connection to appeal to a wider range of members.
- **Sit-to-stand desks**. No matter how comfortable is your furniture, it's difficult to sit a few hours straight. Desks that transform at member's will allow to stretch legs whenever they want and not to take an unplanned break. [ECO-SYSTM](http://www.eco-systm.com/) coworking even provides treadmill desks to compensate the lack of activity for their members.
- **Yoga**. If you offer yoga classes or other sport and fitness activities, members don't have to go somewhere else to workout. What for, if everything they need is nearby? Don't forget about showers and changing rooms if you offer any sort of class that lets members work up a sweat.
- **Nap rooms**. Many people need a nap or just some rest in the middle of their workday to stay productive. If you provide them a wellness place, they don't need to go home and come back or leave earlier due to fatigue.  
- **Great staff**. Your crew is the soul of your coworking. They greet members, assist with minor tasks, facilitate networking, carry out events, and do plenty of other things that involve direct interaction and communication. Make sure that the team is friendly and knowledgeable. The aspect will contribute to the building of your brand image, connections, and lasting relationships.
