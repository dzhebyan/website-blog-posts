Most of the coworking business owners find SEO and marketing activities daunting. It's difficult to blame them as we are usually scared of the things we don't know. Running a business is troublesome, so coworking managers simply don't have time to learn SEO and marketing. Though, this knowledge is crucial if you are not ready to pay professionals for promotion.

This article reveals simple, yet quick and affordable coworking marketing strategies you may start to implement straight away to get the first positive results shortly. 

## Marketing Your Coworking Space—Tips & Tricks

Let's make sure that you have a bare minimum for the start. 

- First of all your **coworking space is up and running**. Please note that sleek contemporary meeting room design is important but that's not all. Your coworking space must start to impress much earlier than a member enters it.

We are talking about [software solutions](https://trello.com/c/yJcJYFt4/50-create-an-outline-for-friday-publication-marketing-tricks-for-coworking-business) that cover the needs of a coworking space in the current elegant manner allowing members to book a meeting room online, managing their membership plan, providing IoT devices, community feed with push notifications, and enabling card payments. 

All these contribute to the utmost usability of your coworking space and gives you additional benefits which you can use in promo campaigns.

1. **You have a live website** that tells a story of your brand. Think of your Unique Value Proposition (UVP). What differentiates you among the competitors and show this to the visitors. Everyone who lands on your web page should instantly understand the advantages of working with you and the value they get by becoming a member.
2. You have **installed these or similar tools**:
    - [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/)—along with getting heaps of statistical data on your resource behavior you will understand what pages are most/least popular. With this data, you will be able to make necessary improvements on time, while they didn't affect the overall website performance.
    - [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)—the tool helps to understand what keywords people use to find you, so you can double down on them in your ad campaigns and optimize your pages.
    - [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/dr/sponsor-biz)—to capture lead information with messages and convert them instantly into customers.

## How to SEO Optimize a Coworking Space Website

Well, you are ready to proceed. Now make sure that Google knows of your website existence. You can check this via Google Search Console or search bar (put `site:yourwebsite.com`.)

Not indexed? Help Google [find your website](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6259634?hl=en) and start to rank.  

### 1. Intelligible Navigation

![andcards Navigation Blocks](https://d7ccq1i35b0cj.cloudfront.net/andcards-my-workspaces-main-futurespace-light-en-1920-1200.jpg|height=1200,width=1920)

We will tell you nothing new here. The point is pretty obvious. Your website should be easy to navigate, your homepage should contain easy-to-find links to the most important pages of your website (about, services, features, contacts).

Many coworking sites make the same mistake, they make the user think which leads them straight to the back button. Leave clear prompts, tell the customer where to go next, guide them through the pages and you will reduce your bounce and site abandonment rate.  

Please refer to the [steps to a Google-friendly site](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/40349?hl=en) article and don't be like the guys featured in such sort of showcases [Breaking Bad: 21 Bad Website Examples (Upd: May, 2019)](https://weblium.com/blog/21-bad-website-examples-of-2018/).   

### 2. Get Rid of the Broken Pages and Links 

No coworking site can benefit from broken pages and links. They are the reason for poor UX and SEO. As you know Google has no mercy to stuff that disappoints the user. 

It's normal to have 404 Not Found errors, yet you must fix (reinstate dead page, redirect dead page to appropriate alternative) the errors for the most important pages—the ones linked to by other sites, older URLs you had in your sitemap and have since deleted, misspelled URLs for important pages, or URLs of popular pages that no longer exist on your site, outbound links.  

The takeaway is—you'd better arrange spring cleaning regularly to keep visitors and Google happy. Keeping your site error-free facilitates easy access of the essential information by Google and visitors.

### 3. Meta Title & Meta Description for Every Page

A lot of coworking websites underestimate the role of meta titles and meta descriptions and write them negligently (if write at all.) These attributes are actually ads displayed on Google. But the sweetest thing is that you don't pay a cent for promotion. Now answer yourself a question - is it wise to miss this brilliant opportunity? Most probably you will want to use it to the fullest. 

Here are simple guides to follow:

- Don't exceed the maximum length at which Google starts to truncate meta in search results (55.09 characters for title and 164.44 characters for description on average).
- Allure users and search engines to click to your site.
- Include your target keyword, which is optional but strongly recommended.   
- Check your meta title and meta description on [serpsim.com](https://serpsim.com).

### 4. Polish Your Writing

You present your meeting room with the help of text. A writing copy plays a significant role in digital marketing for coworking space. Here are some applicable SEO rules to follow if you want Google to consider your webpage a good fit for a particular query:

- Each page of your website should include at least 100–200 words of text.
- Use one H1 tag as the heading of each page. The heading is often used as meta title. 
- Create a clear hierarchy on your pages using H2-H6 tags for subheadings.
- Avoid keyword stuffing. Include target keywords only where they are relevant. 
- Thoroughly spellcheck your copy.  Make sure it is free from errors. Spelling and grammar on your site must be on point.

### 5. Get Cited in the Relevant Places

The next point in the marketing plan for coworking space is getting online mentions (citations) of your business. Such mentions usually include your business name, address, and phone number. Why is it important? When Google determines where to rank your site, not only on-page SEO factors but also off-page ones are considered. Citations are one of those factors.  

We recommend you to start with [Google My Business](https://www.google.com/business/) then try to get listed on other directories relevant to the coworking niche.  

![Google My Business Homepage Screenshot](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/coworking-marketing-9-simple-tips-making-lasting-effect-3.png|height=1080,width=1920)

### 6. Ask Members & Partners for Backlinks

You have surely heard about link building as one of the mandatory coworking marketing strategies. It may seem confusing at the beginning but backlinks are one of the [three major ranking factors](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-top-three-ranking-factors-21827.html) according to Google, so you'd better start building them.

If you are not ready to launch a full-fledged link building campaign right now, we advise you to start small. Ask your existing partners and members for links. And don't forget about testimonials sections available on the websites of your existing relationships. Leave a nice one with a link to your site. The practice is favorable both to your partner and you.

### 7. Your Website Must Load Fast

Most of the users surf the web using their mobile devices. Your members are not the exception either. Statistical data says that 53% of users browsing your website from smartphones will abandon the page if it loads longer than three seconds.

The first thing you need to do is check how fast is your web page. Here is a couple of awesome tools for the purpose:

-  [Google’s PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
-  [GTMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)

![Google PageSpeed Insights Interface](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/coworking-marketing-9-simple-tips-making-lasting-effect-4.png|height=1080,width=1920)

Many things like plugins and bloated HTML may slow down your web page. Take a look at [what can be improved](https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-speed) here. 

BTW, did you hear anything about the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)? We at [andcards](https://andcards.com/) utilize the technology which allows us to create better, faster experiences on the mobile web. You can also consider using the [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerated_Mobile_Pages) and get better ranking on Google.    

### 8. Add Schema Markup

What can [schema](https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) markup do for your business? It helps Google to better understand your website. It can even change the way your web page appears in search results. Everybody likes those review stars and additional information like working hours showing up right under the meta title. This is what schema markup can do for you. 

We recommend you to opt for [LocalBusiness](https://schema.org/LocalBusiness) markup as it is more suitable for businesses having physical locations, like coworking spaces.  

### 9. Run a Blog

Community building is one of the key goals of every coworking hub. A nice blog will help you achieve it efficiently. What's more, a popular blog containing fresh and valuable information is one of the sources of new business opportunities and leads. You are not going to leave money on the table, aren't you? Ok, then start to generate share-worthy content and actively promote it wherever possible.

**Several ways of blog content promotion:**

- Facebook ads, Twitter & LinkedIn followers
- Ask question platforms (Quora, Reddit)
- Email list (Newsletter)
- In-app notifications (social media sharing buttons, newsletter subscription)
- Outreach
- Promotion in relevant communities
- Re-purpose content for different medias (videos, podcasts, etc.)  

## Live Examples of Coworking Business Websites with Quick Marketer's Notes

This section features a few websites intended to present and promote coworking business. Let's take a quick look at their design and functionality from the point of marketing value. 

### [Outsite](https://www.outsite.co/)

![Outside Homepage Screenshot](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/coworking-marketing-9-simple-tips-making-lasting-effect-5.png|height=1080,width=1920)

A clean modern website with enough white space helping visitors focus on absorbing content. Text blocks on the homepage are concise, they clearly communicate corporate values. Multiple call-to-action buttons prompt the visitor their next step. Chat bubble and welcoming auto-message let the visitor feel at home from the very first seconds. A nice example to follow. 

### [WeWork](https://www.wework.com/)

![WeWork Homepage Screenshot](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/coworking-marketing-9-simple-tips-making-lasting-effect-6.png|height=1080,width=1920)

A content-rich website of a big brand with a loud headline. It says “Revolutionize your workplace,” which is ok for a well-known enterprise like WeWork. They may use bold titles because everyone knows them already. However, this approach won't work for a startup, small or medium-sized business. Don't use vague titles that communicate zero value. Opt for something more specific and value-focused.    

### [Selina]( https://www.selina.com/)

![Selina Homepage Screenshot](https://s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/blogs.andcards.com/coworking-marketing-9-simple-tips-making-lasting-effect-7.png|height=1080,width=1920)

Selina homepage is extremely visual. As soon as you enter the homepage your attention is grabbed by a huge slider featuring fascinating landscapes. If you don't know the brand you may even think that this is a travel or hotel website. Again, it's ok for large networks like Selina to enchant their visitors with incredible imagery. Selina brand awareness is high. But if you are just starting up it's better to inform the visitors upfront what you do. It's crucial to have a clear focus.
